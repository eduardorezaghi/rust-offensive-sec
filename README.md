# Rust Offensive Security

This project contains code examples from the book [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust), originally found in this [Github repository](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust/tree/main).
While it follows the examples in the book, I'm also including some examples to improve my understanding of the Rust programming language.
