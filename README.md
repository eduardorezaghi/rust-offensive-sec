# Rust Offensive Security

This project contains code examples from the book [Black Hat Rust](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust) by [Sylvain Kerkour](https://kerkour.com/).  
While it follows the examples in the book, I'm also including language examples in the references/ folder to improve my understanding of the Rust programming language.
